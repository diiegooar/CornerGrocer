# CornerGrocer Project
This program reads a desired text file from the user, which supposedly, has a shopping list. If the user does not input a correct file it terminates the program. <br />
The user is going to choose between different options from the Menu displayed. This program is OOP-based. The class 'CornerGrocer' has OOP characteristics such as **encapsulation**, it hides the internal functionalities of the project, which derivates to **abstraction**, we can see this by setting the map variable on private, and setting it in a different member function. <br /> 
We needed to **pass by reference** in the functions as it is a map and it behaves pretty much like an array. <br />

Feel free to use it and leave any comments! ðŸ˜€
